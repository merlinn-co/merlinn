# Github

This guide shows you how to integrate Merlinn with Github.

## Overview

Merlinn utilizes your Github repos in order to shed light on real-time issues in production. It can access commits, pull-requests, branches, releases and more. Merlinn uses the standard OAuth flow to connect to Github.

**For more information, go to [Github's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps).**

## Prerequisites

- An existing Merlinn account. If you don't have one, you can [sign up](https://app.merlinn.co/) for free.
- An existing organization. To learn how to create one, check the [quickstart](../02-Quickstart.md) guide.

## Setup

Follow these steps to connect Merlinn to Github:

1. Inside your organization settings, go to "Integrations".
2. Locate the "Github" integration and click "Add".
3. Follow the OAuth authorization steps in the modal. Once you're done, return to the dashboard.
4. Click "Connect".
