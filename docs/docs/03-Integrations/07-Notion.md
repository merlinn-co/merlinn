# Notion

This guide shows you how to integrate Merlinn with Notion.

## Overview

Merlinn uses your Notion knowledge base in order to shed light on real-time issues in production. It can access pages, comments and more. Merlinn uses the standard OAuth flow to connect to Notion.

**For more information, go to [Notion's documentation](https://developers.notion.com/docs/authorization#public-integration-authorization-overview).**

## Prerequisites

- An existing Merlinn account. If you don't have one, you can [sign up](https://app.merlinn.co/) for free.
- An existing organization. To learn how to create one, check the [quickstart](../02-Quickstart.md) guide.

## Setup

Follow these steps to connect Merlinn to Notion:

1. Inside your organization settings, go to "Integrations".
2. Locate the "Notion" integration and click "Add".
3. Follow the OAuth authorization steps in the modal. Once you're done, you should see "App installed successfully". You can return to the dashboard.
