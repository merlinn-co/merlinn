# MongoDB

This guide shows you how to integrate Merlinn with MongoDB.

## Overview

Merlinn can access your MongoDB database and query contextual information from it that might be relevant for an active investigation.

## Prerequisites

- An existing Merlinn account. If you don't have one, you can [sign up](https://app.merlinn.co/) for free.
- An existing organization. To learn how to create one, check the [quickstart](../02-Quickstart.md) guide.

## Setup

Follow these steps to connect Merlinn to MongoDB:

1. Inside your organization settings, go to "Integrations".
2. Locate the "MongoDB" integration and click "Add".
3. In the modal, insert your MongoDB DB URI.
4. Click "Connect"

That's it! You can now talk to Merlinn about your database.
